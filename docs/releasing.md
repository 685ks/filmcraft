# Releasing FilmCraft

> **This fork (685ks/filmcraft) releases differently from upstream.** Run **Actions > Release >
> Run workflow** with the version (the `[workspace.package] version` in `Cargo.toml`, e.g.
> `0.10.0`). `.github/workflows/release.yml` calls the shared Arthavan Projects workflow
> `685ks/craft-actions/.github/workflows/release-rust-app.yml@main` (package `filmcraft`, binary
> `filmcraft`), which reads `packaging/app.toml`, builds Windows x64 (`.msi`, `-portable.zip`) and
> creates the release `v<version>` with `SHA256SUMS.txt`, an SBOM and build provenance (a draft
> unless `publish` is ticked). Assets are named `filmcraft-<version>-<os>-<arch>[-portable].<ext>`.
> The Arthavan Projects launcher installs and updates FilmCraft from these releases; the app has
> no updater of its own, and About says "Updates are managed by Arthavan Projects" when the
> launcher started it (`ARTHAVAN_LAUNCHER=1`). The upstream process below (the `release` branch,
> FreeBSD, web and Windows ARM64 builds) is kept for reference and for the packaging scripts it
> describes. This fork ships for Windows only: the macOS, Linux and FreeBSD packaging was removed.

Every push to the `release` branch runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow builds
installers for Windows, plus
the web build, and creates or updates a **draft**
GitHub Release named `FilmCraft v<version>`. Nobody sees a draft until a maintainer publishes it.

User-facing names say **FilmCraft**. Files, binaries and ids stay lowercase
(`filmcraft-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>`, `app.freedev.ainz.ks.FilmCraft`).

## Cutting a release

1. **Bump the version** on `main`. It lives in exactly one place, `[workspace.package] version`
   in the root `Cargo.toml`; every crate inherits it and the packaging scripts read it from there:

   ```sh
   cargo xtask version                 # prints the current version, e.g. 0.2.1
   cargo xtask version set 0.3.0       # or 0.3.0-rc.1; updates Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
   ```

   Commit the change (`Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`) through the normal review flow, as a
   `Release: FilmCraft v0.3.0` commit whose message says what changed for users.
2. **Merge `main` into `release`** (or fast-forward it) and push. The workflow starts by itself.
3. **Wait for the draft.** When every job is done, the
   Releases page has a draft `FilmCraft v0.3.0`, targeting the pushed commit, with every artifact
   and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. The notes are generated from the merged pull requests.
4. **Check it.** Download an installer or two and read the job summaries. A `::warning::` there
   means a signing secret was missing and that artifact is unsigned.
5. **Publish** the draft in the GitHub UI. Publishing creates the `v0.3.0` tag. A version with a
   pre-release suffix (`-rc.1`) is marked as a pre-release.

Pushing to `release` again before you publish rebuilds the same draft and replaces its assets.
Once the draft is published, the workflow refuses to touch that version again: bump it first.

**Test runs:** *Actions › Release › Run workflow* runs the whole pipeline by hand. The optional
`version` input (such as `0.3.0-rc.1`) overrides `Cargo.toml` for that run only; each build job
applies it with `cargo xtask version set` before building. The signing jobs (Windows)
and the draft-release job run in the `release` environment, which only the `release` branch can
use, so pick that branch for a full run. Run from any other branch, it is a dry run: the jobs that
sign nothing (web) build and upload their artifacts to the run, the
signing jobs are refused, and the draft-release job, which needs them, is skipped.

## What gets built

| Platform | Artifacts | Built on |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `filmcraft-<v>-windows-x64.msi`, `filmcraft-<v>-windows-x64-portable.zip` | `windows-latest` |
| Windows x86 (32-bit) | `filmcraft-<v>-windows-x86.msi`, `filmcraft-<v>-windows-x86-portable.zip` | `windows-latest` |
| Windows on ARM64 | `filmcraft-<v>-windows-arm64.msi`, `filmcraft-<v>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` | `windows-latest` (cross-compiled) |
| Web | `filmcraft-web-<v>.zip`, a static site (see [`packaging/web/README.md`](../packaging/web/README.md)) | `ubuntu-latest` |

`filmcraft --version` and `filmcraft-cli --version` print the version from `Cargo.toml`.

**Fonts.** Every build job checks out [craft-fonts](https://github.com/685ks/craft-fonts) at a
pinned commit (the `ref:` of its craft-fonts checkout step, marked `# bump deliberately`) and builds
with `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR` and `CRAFT_FONTS_REQUIRED=1`, so releases embed its Japanese fonts and fail
rather than ship without them (the web build embeds only the UI font, to stay small). The packages
carry each embedded font's licence (`copy_font_licences` in `packaging/env.sh`). Bump the pins
deliberately, in every job at once.

### Windows

`packaging/windows/package.ps1 -Arch x64|x86|arm64` builds with `+crt-static`, so neither the MSI
nor the portable zip needs the Visual C++ redistributable.

- `filmcraft.wxs` (WiX) is a per-machine install into Program Files with a Start Menu shortcut and
  an App Paths entry (Win+R `filmcraft`). Same-version upgrades are allowed, so release candidates
  replace each other.
- The ARM64 build is cross-compiled on the x64 runner. `.github/workflows/windows-arm64.yml`
  installs that MSI on a Windows 11 ARM64 runner, runs `filmcraft-cli --version` natively and
  uninstalls.
- **Signing:** `packaging/windows/sign.ps1` signs the executables and then the `.msi` with
  `signtool`, using whichever material is present: a `.pfx` certificate (`WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`,
  base64, and `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`) or Azure Trusted Signing (the `AZURE_*` secrets). With
  neither, it warns and leaves the files unsigned, so test builds still produce installers.

### Web

The web job builds `apps/filmcraft-web` with `cargo xtask web` (the `wasm-bindgen` CLI must match
the crate's version exactly, `WASM_BINDGEN` in `xtask/src/main.rs`) and zips the static site with
`packaging/web/package.sh`. [`packaging/web/README.md`](../packaging/web/README.md) covers hosting.

## The draft release

The last job waits for every build, downloads their artifacts, writes `SHA256SUMS.txt` and creates
the draft `FilmCraft v<version>` with notes generated from the merged pull requests. If the draft
already exists, it replaces its assets and keeps it a draft. If that version is already published,
the job fails and asks for a version bump (`cargo xtask version set`).

## Secrets

The Windows and draft-release jobs run in the `release` environment, which only the
`release` branch can use and which holds the signing secrets. The other jobs sign nothing and get
no secrets. Every secret is optional: a missing one produces unsigned artifacts and a
warning, never a failed build.

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | the Developer ID certificate (base64 `.p12`), imported into a temporary keychain |
| `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | notarization (`APPLE_PASSWORD` is an app-specific password) |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Windows signing with a `.pfx` |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_CERT_PROFILE` | Windows signing with Azure Trusted Signing |
